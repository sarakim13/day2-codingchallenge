//Day 2 Coding Challenge:
//Make a function that takes in a number (called num), and multiplies it by 2.
//The function should print out the result of the number AND
//the function should print out the original user input.
//Things to think about: What data type do you need? It should work for decimalsâ€”Google around for the data type you need!
//Extension: Use flow-control: if the number is bigger than 10, divide it by 2. If the number is smaller than 10, mulitply the number by -1
//Write your function here!
